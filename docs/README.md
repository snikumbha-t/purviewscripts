Documentation for purviewscripts

This docs/ folder contains usage examples and notes for some of the
most-used scripts in the repository. All examples assume you have a
Python virtual environment active and required packages installed.

See individual pages for usage examples:
- CreateBusinessTerms: docs/CreateBusinessTerms.md
- CreateDataProducts: docs/CreateDataProducts.md

If you'd like more examples for other scripts, tell me which ones and I
will add them.
